# Simple Registration and Login Form

This repository contains a basic example of how to implement a registration and login form connected to a database. It serves as an introduction to form handling in a web application.

### Important Notice

For production use or to ensure better security, it's highly recommended to incorporate proper security measures such as:
- Using **prepared statements** to prevent SQL injection.
- Considering a web framework like **Laravel** for more secure and scalable solutions.
